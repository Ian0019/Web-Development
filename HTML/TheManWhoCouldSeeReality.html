    <h2>Author's Note </h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">“To my friends and family or those around me who have inspired me to create and innovate this book, I thank all of you for helping me and supporting my ideas and helping me with ideas, pictures and fictional places. I have heavily taken inspiration on books from JK. Rowling’s and Greek mythology, so I want to thank those authors and ideas for my book too. I would really appreciate it if you, the reader, help share this book to family members, friends or strangers. Here’s a bit of a fun fact. I started writing this book as an April Fool's joke for my family, but I decided to turn it into a full-fledged book. I had to balance both studying, working on school work and being lazy while writing this book, yet I think it turned out pretty well. Sure, some of the writing is a little weird, but when I started writing this book, I wrote before I could even think. The main character’s name was literally thought up in a second as my brain processed while I was writing, “hmmm…Dean, yeah, Dean Apollo…that sounds pretty right.” I thought. Every character is usually brought into the story in an unusual way. Some of them have unusual names, while some of them have unusual habits. And I think that’s what makes the story somewhat hilarious, depressive sometimes. but at the same time, I hope you, the reader, has a fun read.”<br>
  <br>-SINCERELY, Mickeal Traore

    <h2>Harold</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">One night, at a fuzzy shed in the deep, dark forest, there came
       a man who was sitting at his burrow, looking at the shiny moon in the blackened skies. 
       This man was someone who could see, who could feel, who could hear, who could breathe.
        He was no ordinary man. He could eat poisonous berries without getting sick. He could
         drink oil without feeling off-color. He could jump high to touch the clouds. He had 
         wavy black hair, a large black beard, a muscular tone, was impressively tall, and had a 
         long white robe. Some thought of him to be the greatest man to ever live. 
         Yet, he didn’t deem himself as the greatest. He was very humble, yet noble. 
         Despite being satisfied with immortality, the man still felt dead inside. 
         The man stood up from an oak chair in the burrow and decided to take a walk outside. 
         He got up and opened the oak door from his left and started to walk.
          His feet touched the green grass outside, his hair getting breezed from the air. 
          All of these feelings felt natural to him. While walking, he saw a friend. 
          This friend looked like a small black stickman from his view due to the night still being set in the sky. 									
“Hey Dean, what’s up?” Said his friend, a large and wide smile imprinted on his face. 
His friend was a ginger with eyeglasses, had a long white robe, similar to Dean, 
and was a centaur, a horse body below his waist and a muscular theme on the top of his body. 
“What are you doing here at a time like this?”  Dean questioned. “I could say the same thing to you.” 
The gingered centaur walked over to him. “Hey man, cheer up. You seem so dull!” The ginger said, looking at Dean with a smug smile.
 Dean tried to shrug it off, not expecting him to realize his true emotions. “You’ve got it all wrong, 
 I’m just a little down-” Just before he could speak again, the centaur raised his left human hand and swiftly
  pinched Dean’s muscular forearm, not very hard. “Stop acting so elegantly around me, I’m your friend, not your business partner!” 
  He said sternly with a hint of playfulness. Dean didn’t react to the pinch, instead, he asked his friend a favor. 
  “Sit down Mark, I just wanna talk a little bit.” Dean dropped down on a medium-sized rock, looking at the stars above in the night skies. 
  Mark, his friend, sat down with him, following his gaze towards Dean’s eyes. “You know how immortality can be sometimes. 
  It's an endless pain that lasts for centuries. Some kid like you just wouldn’t understand.” 
  Dean said somberly, before getting a bit playful at his last remark. Mark looked blissfully at Dean. 
  “Well then travel, go on a trip or something! You've been sitting down at your Burrow for a couple of months,” 
  Mark gave Dean a playful punch, “You take life way too seriously for your age. You're 200 years old now!” 
  Mark said, swatting a fly away from his knee. Dean frowned at his complaining. “You can’t be serious.” He said. 
  Mark laughed at Dean’s reaction, before looking up at the skies with Dean and enjoying the sight as well.
   “Of course, I’m being serious! Isn’t being immortal an amazing opportunity?” Dean stood up and started to walk back to his burrow. 
   “You just don’t seem to understand the difficulty of seeing everyone you love die while still looking 30.” 
   Mark decided to not touch on that topic. He instead got up from the stone and started walking with Dean. 
   “Seems like you need a friend, I’ll come along for the night.” As they both walked to Dean’s burrow,
    they spotted a raccoon who seemed to be looking for food. Mark lunged back his left leg, ready to kick it out of the way, 
    although Dean protested, holding up a hand to Mark’s chest. “Wait, he’s harmless.” Dean slowly crouched down to the raccoon’s small height.
     The raccoon looked at him like he was a disease, backing away his paws a little. Dean petted the raccoon as if it was a pet.
      “Are you an idiot?! You’ll get rabies from touching that thing!” Mark shouted at Dean, his eyes wide with disbelief.
       “You’re acting like I’ll die if I get rabies.” Dean scoffed and shouted back at Mark, while still petting the raccoon.
        “Because you will- oh yeah, you’re immortal.” Dean grabbed the raccoon, and they walked back to Dean’s burrow.
         Dean pushed open the sturdy oak door that seemed like it had seen everything with its wide sharp x scars of being opened over and over again.
          The moment Mark got in, Dean pulled the switch on the top of the dirt roof and the burrow torches on the brown cemented walls were soon filled with fire and light. 
          The burrow was filled with many cabinets and books. There were so many books that Mark felt like they were going to all fall and bury him alive. 
          The raccoon quickly ran into the burrow before Dean shut the door. “I haven’t been in here for a while,” Mark said as he sat down on an oak chair that seemed to be homemade, 
          “You’ve quite renovated the place since I’ve been gone, haven’t you?” Dean walked around the burrow, the wood floor creaked as they felt his weight. 
          Dean put water in a green cup and then spilled it into a large metal pot. He then set the pot above a fireplace, the water sizzling as the bottom of the pot turned red. 
          “It’s not like I have anything better to do.” Dean said. The raccoon looked around the place, before eventually settling down on the floor, looking as if he was about to sleep.
           After a few minutes, the pot was fully boiled and water was spilling out of it in a fiery rage. Dean took it off from above the fireplace and spilled the water back into the cup and gave it to Mark. 
           “Careful, it’s hot,” Dean warned Mark, pointing a single finger at him. Mark watched as Dean sat down to put the sleeping raccoon in his lap. “There’s no way you're going to keep that thing…” 
           Mark exclaimed as he drank the hot, steamy water. Dean shrugged, and petted the raccoon gently. They both were seated and talked on and on as the night sky started to clear.
          Mark the centaur and Dean the immortal were very great friends. They’ve been friends for years. 
          As Mark said, Dean was now 2 centuries old and still looked like he was trying to get a wife, kids, and a job. 
          Mark on the other hand, was a young twenty-year-old man ... or you could say, half man, half horse. 
          He had a job as a sculptor in the city of Corfu and was usually working five to six hours a day, weekday to weekend. 
          Mark enjoyed his job, and paid visits to Dean’s burrow every few months. 
          You might say it sounds a little bit aloof, but a month felt like a second to Dean. 
          Mark got up from the croaking oak chair’s, he was about to leave the burrow and go back to the old, ancient city where philosophers lived. 
<br><br><br>“Hey, you’re not going to leave that racoon nameless, are you?” Mark exclaimed, starting to gallop his grooves back to the oak door. Dean looked at Mark, his eyes blissed from their conversations. “You’re right.” Dean thought for a few seconds, before eventually getting an idea. “I got one.” Dean stood up, the wooden floor creaking once again as he welded the raccoon in his arms. “Harold.”
